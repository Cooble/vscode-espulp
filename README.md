# ESP32 ULP coprocessor assembly highlighting for VS Code

Adds syntax highlighting for ESP32 ULP assembly language to VS Code. This extension was written after spending a week trying to write I2C driver in pure black and white. It is directly based on [ESP32 ULP Documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/system/ulp_instruction_set.html).

## Install
First install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). In the command palette (`cmd-shift-p`) select `Install Extension` and choose `espulp`.
